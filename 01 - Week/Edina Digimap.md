# EDINA Digimap

*EDINA* is the main provider of spatial data to educational institutions in the UK. It focuses on the provision of Ordnance Survey (national mapping
agency), geological and hydrological data (through its *Digimap* site),
as well as UK boundary data, detailing the locations of various UK
administrative boundaries.

Access to this data is free for academic use but requires a registration
that may take a few days to be confirmed. As part of your course you
may need to download data from these locations yourself, so it is
important that you register early.

To register with *EDINA*:

1.  Go to [digimap.edina.ac.uk](https://digimap.edina.ac.uk) and click Login.

2.  Click on the UCL logo to continue (if outside UCL network, you will need to search for UCL). You will be directed to the UCL Single Sign-On page where you should enter your universal UCL username and password.

3.  You will be directed to the *EDINA Digimap* front page, here click on ‘Ordnance Survey Collection’.

4.  At this point you will be asked to register, please complete this registration using your UCL email address where asked. Once you are registered, you will enter through the same way but will bypass registration. This registration will also grant you access to the boundary datasets.

5.	Feel free to register for the Environment, Aerial, Lidar and other collections as and when you require it.
