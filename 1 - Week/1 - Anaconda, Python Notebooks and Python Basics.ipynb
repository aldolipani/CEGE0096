Some of\nthe content has been changed/removed for brevity.\n\nThere are **three short unassessed exercises** to complete during this practical.\nThe exercises are straightforward, and are intended to familiarise you with the Python syntax.\nThey also get you thinking about how you will solve problems using programming."
