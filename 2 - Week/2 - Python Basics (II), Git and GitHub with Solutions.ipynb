To do this we use the Version Control Software, Git. \n\nBut before using it we need to install it. To do this you need to run the command `conda install git` in your anaconda prompt (make sure to be in the `geospatial` environment). To check if we have correctly installed Git run `git --version`.\n\nOnce we have installed it, we can now create a repository for the `Exercise_10` project by typing (from insidie the folder):\n\n`$ git init`\n\nAfter the repository has been initialized you can check its status by typing:\n\n`$ git status`\n\nBefore making our first commit. We want to add a remote to this repository. To do this we create a private repository in GitHub named `CEGE0096: 2nd Practical`. Then, add this remote repository to your local one using the command:\n\n`$ git remote add origin <url>`\n\nYou can check if this remote has been added correctly by typing:\n\n`$ git remote -v`"
